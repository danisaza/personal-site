          Indie Hackers podcast
        </a>{' '}
        is an interview series that features some of the most notable names in
        the indie software community.
      </p>

        tips for current and aspiring internet entrepreneurs.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you're interested in online businesses, this podcast is a
        must-listen.

      <h3>Software Engineering Daily (w/ Jeff Meyerson)</h3>
      <p>
        Jeff Meyerson is a Software Engineer turned podcast host. He brings
        technical folks onto{' '}

          the podcast
        </a>{' '}
        to discuss their areas of expertise in depth.
      </p>
      <p>
        This podcast is not for the faint of heart. You will learn a lot about
        technical topics, and I recommend listening in an environment where
        you'll be able to focus.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, you won't walk away an expert from having listened to a
        podcast episode about something, but it's a great way to get a thorough
        overview of a specific topic.

      <h3>The Secure Developer (w/ Guy Podjarny)</h3>

          this podcast
        </a>
        , Guy Podjarny - the CEO of Snyk - hosts various security experts to
        talk about tooling and best practices for promoting security within your
        organization.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've learned about security topics and about fostering a culture of
        collective ownership over security. (Plus, the concepts are often
        applicable to other facets of software engineering â€“ like testing.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Even if you don't work in Security, I highly recommend this podcast,
        especially if you work in engineering leadership.
